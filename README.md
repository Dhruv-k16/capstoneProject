In today's fast-paced world, many employees and students living away from home struggle to access nutritious and affordable meals.
Existing solutions either compromise on nutrition, affordability, or convenience.
Many meal services rely on commercial kitchens, lacking the homemade food experience.
Current Gap: No structured system empowers homemakers while maintaining low-cost, high-quality food delivery.
Proposed Solution: A sustainable meal delivery system where homemakers prepare home-cooked meals and distribute them efficiently.
